<h2>This is me</h2>

<img src="img/17.jpg" alt="Scary Kid" style="border-width:4px;"> <!--I understood Part 4 like this, that you add 2px to the x px that is written in the css file to increase the border width on that spesific picture. So if I write 4 px width in my style.css sheet and then write 6 px in the about.html sheet, the border will increase with 2 px.-->

<h4>My coding skill and expectation to the course:</h4>
<p>I have used html before, but that's several years ago and it wasn't that much.<br>
     So I'm kind of starting at scratch there. I have also taken a couse in python</p>
	 
<p>I hope to learn a lot in this course an in the end will be able to create  interesting<br>
     web pages. I also hope that therory will explained thorough</p>
	 
<p>I promise I'm not a clown!... Promise</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
        <h4> 1. What does the server in the client server architecture do? </h4>
<p>A server in the client server architecture provides services or resources <br>
       to the client. The server gets a request and looks if it has the information, <br>
       if not it sends the request to another server. The server communicates with <br>
       the client over a network or internet connection. </p>
	   
<h4>  2.What does the client do?</h4>
<p>The client request information or services from the server or servers, a client <br>
	  can be connected to serval servers at the same time.</p>

<h4>3. What is an IP address?</h4>
<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique address assigned to a unit, like a <br>
	  computer or printer in a TCP/IP-based network. The IP addresses are numeric <br>
	  and logical, they are divided into 2 parts, the network part and the host part. <br>
	  The network part shows which network the device is a part of and the host <br>
	  part pinpoints the devices exact location.</p>

<h4>4. What is DNS?</h4>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) transform domain names to IP addresses and <br>
	 has a phone list on its server. If the domain name (letâ€™s say ntnu.no) is on the <br>
	 DNS, the DNS will send back the IP address, so the device that requested the <br>
	 IP address knows where to go</p>

<h4>5. What is the difference between the Internet and WWW?</h4>
<p> The difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web is that the <br>
	  Internet is the big wide thing that connects millions of computers together <br>
	  that talk together and forms what we know as the Internet.  While the Web<br>
	  is a way to access the information over the Internet with languages lite HTTP <br>
	  or browsers like Chrome. The Web is just a part of the Internet, a way to use it. </p>
